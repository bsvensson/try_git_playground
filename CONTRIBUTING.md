We are excited that you are interested in improving the flex viewer source code. This guide will help make sure your contribution (pull request) will be accepted and easily merged.

1. Fork the develop branch.

1. Write code to fix the problem.  Follow the coding already used in the Flex Viewer source code (spaces instead of tabs, proper indentation, use FlexFormatter - https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-viewer-flex/blob/develop/FlexFormatter.properties) and document your code.
1. Test your code
1. Submit a pull request against the "develop" branch.  Submitting a pull request will open a GitHub issue.
