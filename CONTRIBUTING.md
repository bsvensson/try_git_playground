This guide describes how you can contribute improvements to the ArcGIS Viewer for Flex source code.

The ArcGIS Viewer for Flex is developed by the Flex Team at [Esri](http://www.esri.com) and contributors like you. We are excited that you are interested in improving the ArcGIS Viewer for Flex source code. This guide will help make sure your contribution (pull request) will be accepted and easily merged:

1. Fork the develop branch.
2. Create a new feature branch on your local machine.  The name of the branch doesn't matter, but as a best practice use a descriptive name like "fix-look-of-widgetgroup-hover-state".
3. Test your code.
4. Write code to fix the problem.  Follow the coding conventions already used in the Flex Viewer source code (spaces instead of tabs, proper indentation, use [FlexFormatter](http://sourceforge.net/projects/flexformatter/) along with our settings - https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-viewer-flex/blob/develop/FlexFormatter.properties) and document your code.
5. Submit a pull request against the "develop" branch.  Submitting a pull request will open a GitHub issue.

What happens after the pull request?
We will review your pull request
