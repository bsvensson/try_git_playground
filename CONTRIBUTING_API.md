# Contributing to the API samples for ArcGIS API for Flex

There are several ways you can contribute to the [ArcGIS API for Flex samples](http://links.esri.com/flex).

* Report potential bugs to [Esri Support](http://support.esri.com/) and/or create a GitHub issue for it.
* Contribute sample code to the [Flex API Samples repo](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-samples-flex/).

This guide describes how you can contribute improvements to these Flex API samples.
This guide will help make sure your contribution (pull request) will be accepted and easily merged.

1. Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the [Flex API samples repo](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-samples-flex/) on GitHub.
3. Clone it to your local machine.
4. Checkout the [develop branch](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-samples-flex/tree/develop).
5. Create a new feature branch on your local machine.
    * The name of the branch doesn't matter, but as a best practice use a descriptive name like "BufferSample-suppport-other-projections".
6. Write code to add an enhancement or fix the problem.
    * Follow the coding conventions already used in the samples (spaces instead of tabs, proper indentation, use [Flex Formatter](http://sourceforge.net/projects/flexformatter/files/) along with our [Flex Formatter settings](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-viewer-flex/blob/develop/FlexFormatter.properties)).
    * Document your code.
    * Make commits of logical units.
    * Use [clear and descriptive commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
7. Test your code.

### Submitting changes
1. Read the License section below.
2. Push the changes in your feature branch to your repo.
